# RhythmCount: Documentation
RhythmCount represents a Python package for detecting and analysing rhythmic patterns in count data. It consists of two modules:
* [data_processing](docs_data_processing.md): specific functions for building and comparing models, cleaning data, calculating confidence intervals, etc.

* [plot](docs_plot.md): specific functions for plotting (e.g. plotting models, raw data).

This documentation describes the main functions for data cleaning, cosinor regression for count data, and comparing models.

---------------------------
To use these modules include the following code in your Python file:

`from RhythmCount import plot, data_processing` 

RhythmCount can be installed using pip with the command:

`pip install RhythmCount`
